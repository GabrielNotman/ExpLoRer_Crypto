You will need to install the Arduino IDE and add the SODAQ SAMD boards.

The SODAQ SAMD boards will be available for installation in the Boards Manager after you add this URL to Preferences->Additional_Boards_Manager_URLs:
http://downloads.sodaq.net/package_sodaq_samd_index.json

After installation of the boards files, you will need to select the SODAQ ExpLoRer as the target board and the appropriate port.

After compiling and uploading the sketch, you can use the Bash scripts in /scripts to complete the following steps.

1. Run genKeyPair.sh, this will create a key pair for the host.
2. Copy host public key shown in the terminal and paste to the ExpLoRer.
3. Copy device public key from ExpLoRer.
4. Run createPubPem.sh, paste device public key when prompted.
5. Run genSecret.sh, compare shared secret with the one generated by the ExpLoRer.
6. Run decryptECB.sh using cipher data from ExpLoRer.
7. Run decryptCBC.sh using cipher data from ExpLoRer.
8. Run encryptECB.sh and send cipher data to the ExpLoRer.
9. Run encryptCBC.sh and send cipher and IV data to the ExpLoRer.
